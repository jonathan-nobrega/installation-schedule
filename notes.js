/**
 * minimum viable solution:
 * 
 * 1. Create dummy data: array of Workers and Buildings
 * 2. Create method schedule(buildings, employees)
 * 3. Print array with week days planning
 * 
 * Future improvements: 
 * 
 * a. Create UI - Develop a user interface than running it straight from a prompt
 * b. Create REST API - Transfer business logic to a separate backend
 * c. Create database - Extend functionallaty by storing teams presets 
 * 
 * Considerations:
 * 
 * The business logic should be handled in the back-end. Therefore, a REST API could be appropriate.
 * Let's say we realize a commercial building doesn't require 8 people to be done, but only 6.
 * The API should be able to receive the list buildings and employees, 
 * and return a schedule based on updated productivity parameters.
